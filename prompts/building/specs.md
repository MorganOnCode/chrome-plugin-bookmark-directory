The output will be a CSV file that can be imported into a database or spreadsheet, or turned into a directory of useful information that can be shared with others.

One technical consideration is that Google does not allow web apps outside of their Chromium plugin ecosystem to download users' bookmarks. So a Chrome plugin would have to be developed in order to export bookmarks into either HTML or JSON formats so that we can do processing.

I want a single page application that accepts Google Chrome bookmarks bookmarks (html or JSON) and converts them to a range of formats, starting with .csv

The table output from the original file, will act as a directory that can be publicly shared (via link sharing or social media sharing buttons)

The table will need to have some data enrichment done to go from the user inputted bookmarks file, containing URLs and titles, the meta data can be pulled from the URL (as much as possible, favicon, logo, meta-title, meta-description, meta-image etc.)

Typical headings might be: 'URL', 'title', 'image', 'description', type of business
